# Sample APEX Apps
Listed below are sample applications that leverage Autonomous Database.

Autonomous Database is already configured with APEX. After creating your APEX workspace, simply import the applications using the APEX App Builder.

## ADB Chat
ADB Chat allows you to query data in Autonomous Database using natural language. It uses the AI profiles that are in the current user's schema. Those profiles support both natural language to SQL as well as RAG.
